-- | First, let us create a tiny two-dimensional vector class.

-- | Now, let us introduce the concepts of 'Mass', 'Velocity',
-- 'Momentum' and 'KineticEnergy'. Any such concepts are described
-- in terms of 'Member' labels.
data Mass = Mass deriving (Typeable)
instance (Objective o, UseReal o) => Member o Mass where
  type ValType o Mass = UnderlyingReal o

-- we use 'UnderlyingReal' to
-- ask the object which real value it prefers, then put the response
-- into the type constructors.

-- | Now we define the accessors. Accessors for 'Member's without default methods are

-- | If the 'velocity' field is missing, we attempt to re-calculate it

velocity = memberLens Velocity

-- | If the 'momentum' field is missing, we re-calculate it

momentum = memberLens Momentum

-- | 'kineticEnergy', unless given explicitly, is defined in terms of 'mass' and 'velocity' .
kineticEnergy :: (UseReal o, Fractional (UnderlyingReal o)) => MemberLens o KineticEnergy
kineticEnergy = memberLens KineticEnergy 

-- | We can write functions that would construct a point particle from
--   its mass and velocity. And we can make the function polymorphic over the
--   representation of the real numbers the objects prefer.
fromMassVelocity :: (Objective o, UseReal o, Fractional real, real ~ (UnderlyingReal o))
                    => real -> Vec real -> o

-- | We can also construct a point particle from
--   its mass and momentum.
fromMassMomentum :: (Objective o, UseReal o, Fractional real, real ~ (UnderlyingReal o))
                    => real -> Vec real -> o
fromMassMomentum m v =
   empty & insert Mass m
         & insert Momentum v

-- | We define an instance of point-like particle.  And again, we can
-- keep it polymorphic, so that anyone can choose its concrete type
-- later, according to their purpose.  Thus we will achieve the
-- polymorphic encoding of the knowledge of this world, in Haskell.

-- Moreover, we can ask Ichiro to sign the ball. Usually, we needed to
-- create a new data-type to add a new field. But with
-- 'dynamic-object' we can do so without changing the type of the
-- ball. So, we can put our precious, one-of-a-kind ball
-- into toybox together with less uncommon balls, and with various
-- other toys. And still, we can safely access the contents of the
-- toybox without runtime errors, and e.g. see which toy is the heaviest.
